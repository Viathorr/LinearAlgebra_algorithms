# Lab3(a) + Lab2(partially)

### _(Multitreading/Sequential) Array Sorting Algorithms_ + Linear Algebra Some Algorithms (only sequential, not as part of Lab3)


## Design Patterns used:
- ***Abstract Factory*** (SortingAbstractFactory that creates instances of Sorting Algorithm classes)
- ***Singleton*** (implementation of Abstract Factory as Singleton)
- ***Proxy*** (ArraySortingProxy that checks type of array elements before proceeding to sorting operation)
- ***Decorator*** (ExecutionTimeDecorator that adds to simple sorting algorithm class an ability to compute the execution time of certain algorithm)
